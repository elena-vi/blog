I am currently using [Vim-Instant-Markdown](https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown) to help me write markdown inside the vim text editor. It is a plugin that opens up a new browser window to localhost:8090 which automatically updates with a live rendering of the markdown in html, so you see the results as you type. Since jekyll uses markdown, it is really easy to make blog posts directly in vim!
