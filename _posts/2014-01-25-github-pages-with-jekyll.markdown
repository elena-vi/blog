This site has been made statically with [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted on [github pages][github-pages], using [namecheap][namecheap] domain purchased with [Bitcoin][bitcoin]! Statically-generated pages are all the rage now...instead of wasting precious server cpu resources to generate pages on the fly, you can just generate the pages once on your computer and upload as static html, allowing really fast downloads and so you can host your site for free on github or dropbox!
